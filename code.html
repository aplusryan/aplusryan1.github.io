      <h2> Hey! </h2>
      <p> You might've already learned a bit about my programming journey from the home page. Hopefully here you can learn some more!
      As you may know, I do code in Swift, HTML/CSS, and Arduino C. With Swift and HTML/CSS I have completely taught myself,
      I learned the basics of ArduinoC at Choate. Such as, I coded this website in HTML/CSS. I also coded one app (not on app store, for myself) that I will talk about
    later. I will also talk about my Arduino code and projects that I have done on my page, in additon to how I developed this page. I programmed every bit of this page with
  HTML/CSS , used a framework called Bootstrap to help build the website, and used a javascript program called wow.js for the animations. I also used a program call Formspree to
create the contact form, which sends me an email of whatever a person has sent me through the form. </p>

        <h2>Arduino</h2>
        <p>
          In the summer of 2018 I went to my first camp, and my first time living away from home in my life.
           I just moved in to my dorm at Choate to start the Invention and Design lab.
           Little did I know how this camp would kickstart my interest in electrical and mechanical engineering.
           At this camp I learned the very basics of wiring and using an Arduino and hardware components.
           With this newfound knowledge and interest I went home to start making my own projects.
           If you click the icon on the left you will find my playlist of Arduino videos,
           containing the video of my most elementary projects to the projects that carried a larger weight of
           complexity.If you click on the GitHub icon, you will find my GitHub page with my Arduino projects.
            Enjoy browsing!

      <h2>Swift</h2>
      <p>Swift is probably my favorite language so far. Ever since I played my first video game on my Uncle's iPad
        I was struck with curiousity on how such a thing could exist. Soon after I tried learning the language through various
        resources before finding a Udemy course which I am currently 50% complete. I have coded many projects within my UDemy course
        but I have coded one project for myself. This project is an app that plays sounds of the character whose button you press.
        you can find this project on my GitHub. This language is my most ambitions endeavor and one that I hope continues.<p>

        <h2> HTML/CSS </h2>
        <p>HTML/CSS is the last one on my coding page. This was the first step into computer science. I started to learn the basics of basics
          of HTML/CSS on CodeAcademy which I just recently finished. On that online course I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and how
          to use Bootstrap, a framework that gives extra features to website developers. In fact, this website use to have a previous version
          which had the very basics of when I first learned to code. You can find the website at:
          https://aplusryan.github.io/aplusryan.github.io-aplusryanV1/
           As you can see that website was lightyears behind this one. I am proud to say how far I have come. Every piece of this website I have
          programmed, and many of these features I spent countless hours on, such as the banner on the home page where I took each photo, edited it, and coded into the website,
          in additon to this split screen layout which I spent hours on the internet to find a solution. I hope you enjoyed this website!<p>
